### Overview

Take a triangle (X,Y,Z) and find its centre C. Draw lines XC, YC, ZC and recurse on triangles (X,Y,C), (Y,Z,C), (Z,X,C).
For some triangle centres the result is a fractal.
To add variety, instead of always using the same centre you can switch between two: either alternating each time or following a more complicated sequence.
